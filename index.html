                This is a visualization that shows the total number of bike departures per month from the top three most trafficked <br> Zagster bike rental stations in Bend, OR 
                during 2018. Zagster is a ride share program that allows users to rent bikes by the hour. <br> The top three most trafficked bike stations were at OSU cascades 
                (Oregon State University campus in Bend), the Old Mill <br> (a shopping district along side the Deschutes river), and Drake park (A frequented park along the Deschutes
                river). The monthly<br>  totals allow us to see the affect the college students have on the bikes, with highs at the college campus in September; the start of <br>  OSUâ€™s fall
                term. This visualization is made using chart.js and jQuery, which are JavaScript libraries that allow for easy data <br>  visualization and working with data. The data
                comes from an external database and is fetched used jQuery. The data is then <br> narrowed down to what is needed, in this case the number of ride uses by location per
                month, and then fed into chart.js to visualize.
